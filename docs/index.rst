Accelerate is an embedded language of array computations for high-performance
computing in Haskell. Computations on multi-dimensional, regular arrays are
expressed in the form of parameterised collective operations, such as maps,
reductions, and permutations. These computations are online-compiled and
executed on a range of architectures.
