-- "open research question"
-- -- Each set of ints corresponds to a set of Constructions, which themselves contain a set of ints (the things they depend on).
-- -- Some of those ints will refer to nodes in previous clusters, others to nodes in this cluster.
-- One pass over these datatypes (back-to-front) should identify the 'output type' of each cluster: which nodes are needed in later clusters?
-- Then, we can construct the clusters front-to-back:
--    identify the nodes that only depend on nodes outside of the cluster, they are the initials
--    the `output type` indicates which nodes we will need to keep: they are all either a final node in the cluster, or get diagonally fused
-- How exactly we can use this information (and a dep. graph) to construct a cluster of ver,hor,diag is not clear.. Will also depend on the exact cluster definition.

{-
Within each cluster (Labels), we do a topological sort using the edges in Graph
((a,b) means a before b in ordering). Then, we can simply insert them front-to-back:
existing `In` arguments are never touched, existing `Out` arguments are matched with
new `In` arguments vertically or diagonally (depending on if they'll be needed still),
new `Out` arguments are never touched. We can even do the re-ordering of Args as we go
on the fresh leaves, never need to touch the existing tree.
  Note that we basically build a list instead of a binary tree. 
  Could refactor Cluster to reflect this.

Data.Graph (containers) has a nice topological sort. Then we just need to know, given
such an ordering, what the live args should be at each point, or even just the death points
of each arg.

-- Note that the return type `a` is not existentially qualified: The caller of this function tells

-- fulfill this contract: if something goes wrong during fusion or at the caller, bad things happen.

-- | This function can - and, until it's stable, will - throw errors. 
-- It is very partial, even ignoring the unsafeCoerce:
-- - fromJust calls are used when a re-indexing is expected to succeed
-- - errors are thrown when certain invariants are not met
-- - partial indexing is used in the M.IntMaps
-- none of these situations can be recovered from, so we crash and hope to diagnose the stack trace.
-- Some errors, in particular the second category, which explicitly calls 'error', could reasonably
-- be statically avoided. The rest is a result of the inherently partial practice of constructing
-- a strongly typed AST using the ILP output.

{- [NOTE unsafeCoerce result type]

  Because we lose some type information by rebuilding the AST from scratch, we use
  unsafeCoerce to tell GHC what the result type of the computation is.
  TypeApplications allows us to specify the exact types unsafeCoerce works on,
  which in turn helps retain as much typesafety as possible.
