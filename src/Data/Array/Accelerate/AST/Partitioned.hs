-- | These definitions are far from guaranteeing a unique representation;
-- there are many equivalent ways to represent a clustering, even ignoring
-- the ambiguity in SwapArgs (where you can make many convoluted versions
-- of `id`). I don't think this is a big deal, but since it seems to always
-- be possible to construct a Cluster by appending a single element at a time,
-- it might be better to refactor this into a pseudo list (instead of binary tree).
-- Even then, every topologically sorted order will be a valid sequence.
data Cluster op args where
  -- Currently, we only swap the order of the arguments at the leaves. 
  -- This is needed to be able to horizontally fuse (x -> y -> a) with (y -> x -> a).
  -- I think it is also sufficient to do it only at leaves, and not in every node.
  -- Maybe putting it in the nodes will turn out to be easier though!

-- in the types (especially while abstracting over backends), instead we will need

-- | All these options will, in general, require the underlying Clusters to be weakened
-- by adding superfluous Args. The constructors below are the only way to "remove Args".
